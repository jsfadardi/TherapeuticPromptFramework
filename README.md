# Therapeutic Prompt Framework

A structured multi-prompt system for enhancing AI language models' responses to psychological and therapeutic scenarios.

## Project Overview

This framework uses a three-prompt architecture to improve how AI models handle complex psychological cases:

1. **Contextual Framing**: Establishes therapeutic boundaries and ethical guidelines
2. **Case Conceptualization**: Guides structured psychological assessment using multiple theoretical frameworks
3. **Response Calibration**: Ensures appropriate clinical tone and therapeutic alignment

## Evaluation Results

The framework was tested with 50 simulated therapy scenarios, with responses evaluated by licensed psychologists. Results showed:

- 37% improvement in clinical accuracy
- 42% reduction in potentially harmful responses
- Significant improvements in cross-cultural sensitivity and theoretical integration

## Usage

Each prompt in the framework serves a specific function in the chain. See individual prompt files and the evaluation methodology for implementation details.
