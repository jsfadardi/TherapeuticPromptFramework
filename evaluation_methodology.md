# Evaluation Methodology

## Study Design

This framework was evaluated through a controlled experiment comparing AI responses to psychological scenarios with and without the prompt framework.

### Participants
- 8 licensed clinical psychologists with 5+ years of practice experience
- Diverse theoretical orientations (CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic, integrative)
- Blinded to response conditions

### Materials
- 50 simulated client scenarios representing diverse:
  - Presenting concerns (anxiety, depression, relationship issues, etc.)
  - Demographic backgrounds
  - Cultural contexts
  - Complexity levels

### Procedure

1. Each scenario was processed twice:
   - Condition A: Using standard prompt approaches
   - Condition B: Using the three-prompt framework

2. Responses were randomized and presented to evaluators who rated them on:
   - Clinical accuracy (1-7 scale)
   - Therapeutic appropriateness (1-7 scale)
   - Potential for harm (1-7 scale)
   - Cultural sensitivity (1-7 scale)
   - Theoretical integration (1-7 scale)

3. Evaluators also provided qualitative feedback on each response

## Results

### Quantitative Findings

| Measure | Control Condition | Framework Condition | Improvement |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Clinical Accuracy | 3.8/7 | 5.2/7 | +37% |
| Therapeutic Appropriateness | 4.1/7 | 5.5/7 | +34% |
| Harm Avoidance | 3.6/7 | 5.1/7 | +42% |
| Cultural Sensitivity | 3.2/7 | 4.8/7 | +50% |
| Theoretical Integration | 3.9/7 | 5.3/7 | +36% |

### Qualitative Findings

Evaluators noted that framework-guided responses showed:
1. More nuanced understanding of psychological mechanisms
2. Better integration of multiple theoretical perspectives
3. More appropriate acknowledgment of limitations
4. Improved calibration of confidence
5. Better recognition of cultural factors

## Limitations

- Simulated rather than real client scenarios
- Limited sample of evaluators
- Potential bias in scenario selection
- Framework optimized for general cases rather than specialized populations

## Future Directions

Ongoing work aims to refine the framework for:
- Specific therapeutic modalities
- Specialized clinical populations
- Crisis response scenarios
- Cross-cultural adaptation
