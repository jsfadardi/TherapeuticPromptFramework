# Prompt 2: Case Conceptualization

This prompt guides the model in applying structured psychological analysis to client scenarios.

## The Prompt

For the case presented, provide a structured analysis following these steps:
1. Identify potential relevant psychological mechanisms from multiple theoretical perspectives (cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, humanistic, systems)
2. Consider potential cultural and contextual factors that might influence presentation
3. Analyze the case through both nomothetic (general principles) and idiographic (individual uniqueness) lenses
4. Identify patterns that may connect presenting concerns to underlying psychological processes
5. Consider how different evidence-based approaches might conceptualize this situation
6. Note significant information gaps that would be important for complete assessment

Present your analysis in a clear, organized manner that acknowledges complexity and avoids premature conclusions.

## Design Principles

This prompt incorporates:
1. Multiple theoretical frameworks
2. Cultural and contextual awareness
3. Balance between general principles and individual uniqueness
4. Recognition of information limitations
5. Structured analytical approach

## Implementation Notes

This prompt should be applied after the contextual framing prompt and before response calibration. It helps the model organize psychological information in a clinically useful manner.
