# Example Application

Below is an example of how the three-prompt framework transforms AI responses to a psychological scenario.

## Sample Scenario

> A 45-year-old executive reports increasing difficulty concentrating at work, irritability with colleagues, and trouble sleeping. They mention feeling "hollow" despite recent professional success, and wonder if they're experiencing burnout or depression. They recently moved to a new country for their position and are separated from their family who will join them in 6 months.

## Standard Response (Without Framework)

*This response was generated without the therapeutic prompt framework:*

"Based on your symptoms, you're likely experiencing either burnout or depression. Burnout is work-related chronic stress characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy. Depression is a mood disorder with persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest.

You should try to get more sleep, exercise regularly, and practice mindfulness. Consider talking to a therapist who can help you determine if you have depression and might need medication. Work-life balance is important, so try to set boundaries at work.

Being separated from your family is probably contributing to your feelings. Try to stay connected with them virtually and focus on the fact that they'll join you soon."

## Framework-Enhanced Response

*This response was generated using the three-prompt framework:*

"Thank you for sharing your experience. What you're describing involves several psychological domains - emotional (feeling 'hollow'), cognitive (concentration difficulties), behavioral (sleep disturbances), and social (irritability with colleagues).

From a cognitive-behavioral perspective, your situation presents multiple potential stressors that could be affecting your mood and functioning: job demands, cultural transition, family separation, and adaptation to a new environment. These stressors could be activating certain thought patterns that influence your emotional state.

Psychodynamically, the feeling of hollowness despite success might reflect a disconnection between external achievements and internal emotional needs. The family separation could be triggering attachment-related responses.

From a biopsychosocial standpoint, several factors may be interacting:
- Biological: Sleep disruption affecting mood regulation
- Psychological: Adjustment challenges and potential identity shifts
- Social: Reduced support system and cultural transition

While some symptoms overlap with depression and burnout, it's important to note that adjustment reactions to major life changes can present similarly. A clinical assessment would need to consider:
- Timeline of symptoms relative to your move
- Pre-existing psychological patterns
- Cultural factors in how distress manifests
- Complete sleep and health evaluation

If you're working with a mental health professional, they would likely want to explore both immediate coping strategies and deeper understanding of how this transition interacts with your psychological needs and identity. They might also distinguish between expatriate adjustment reactions (which often follow predictable stages) and clinical conditions requiring specific interventions.

I should note that without a comprehensive assessment, these observations are necessarily limited and preliminary. Cultural factors in both your country of origin and new location would be important considerations in a full assessment."

## Key Improvements

The framework-enhanced response demonstrates:

1. **Structured analysis** across multiple psychological domains
2. **Integration of theoretical perspectives** without privileging one approach
3. **Recognition of cultural and contextual factors** in the adjustment process
4. **Appropriate clinical caution** and acknowledgment of assessment limitations
5. **Avoidance of premature conclusions** or simplistic advice-giving
6. **Professional tone** balancing accessibility with clinical precision
